Dedispersed dynamic spectrum and frequency averaged time series of a fast radio burst from FRB 20201124A, detected with the Westerbork-RT1 25-m telescope at a central frequency of 1323.49 MHz. The data is dedispersed using DM=410.775 pc cm^-3 and is plotted at a time and frequency resolution of 1024 us and 4 MHz, respectively. The MJD of the burst at infinite frequency at the solar system barycentre (in TDB) is 59602.992809162. The burst is discussed in more detail in [Ould-Boukattine et al. (2022, ATel #15190)](https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15190).

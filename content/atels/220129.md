Dedispersed dynamic spectra and frequency averaged time series of three bursts from FRB 20201124A detected with the Westerbork-RT1 25-m telescope at a central frequency of 1323.49 MHz. The data are dedispersed using DM=410.775 pc cm^-3. The left burst is plotted at a time and frequency resolution of 1024 us and 4 MHz. The middle burst is plotted at a time and frequency resolution of 512 us and 2 MHz. The right burst is plotted at a time and frequency resolution of 512 us and 125 kHz. The MJDs of the bursts at infinite frequency at the solar system barycentre (in TDB) are 59603.754507227, 59603.799227754 and 59605.835730597, respectively. These bursts are discussed in more detail in [Ould-Boukattine et al. (2022, ATel #15192)](https://www.astronomerstelegram.org/?read=15192).

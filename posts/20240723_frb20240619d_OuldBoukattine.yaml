caption: "Incoherently dedispersed dynamic spectrum (bottom) and frequency-averaged time-series (top) of a burst from FRB 20240619D detected with the Westerbork RT1 25-m telescope at a central frequency of 1.27 GHz. The data are dedispersed using DM = 464.87 pc cm<sup>-3</sup>. The time and frequency resolutions are labeled in the figure. The arrival time of the burst at infinite frequency at the Solar System barycentre is MJD 60511.994415889 (TDB)."
